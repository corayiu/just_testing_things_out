In NMSA, we create new musical instruments, multimedia installations, live audiovisual performances, music production, interactive objects and wearables, new sonic ecologies, electronic textiles, and interactive sculptures. NMSA emphasizes processes of working with electronic technologies and cultivates interest in how these new tools continually shape, and are shaped by, cultures.
